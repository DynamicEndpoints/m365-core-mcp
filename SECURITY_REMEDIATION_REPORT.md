## Remaining Vulnerability

### ⚠️ **REMAINING: xlsx** (High Severity)
- **Issue:** Prototype Pollution in sheetJS & Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
- **CVE:** GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6, GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9
- **Current Version:** `^0.18.5`
- **Status:** ⚠️ **NO FIX AVAILABLE** (per npm audit)
- **Risk Assessment:** This package is used for Excel file processing in audit reports
- **Mitigation:** Consider alternative packages like `exceljs` or `node-xlsx` for future updates

## Actions Taken

1. **Updated @azure/identity:** `^3.3.0` → `^4.2.1`
2. **Updated puppeteer:** `^21.0.0` → `^23.8.0`
3. **Applied npm audit fix:** Resolved transitive dependency vulnerabilities
4. **Applied npm audit fix --force:** Resolved remaining fixable vulnerabilities with breaking changes

## Security Improvement

- **Before:** 16 vulnerabilities (1 low, 1 moderate, 14 high)
- **After:** 1 vulnerability (1 high)
- **Improvement:** **93.75% reduction** in total vulnerabilities
- **Eliminated:** All medium severity vulnerabilities
- **Eliminated:** 13 out of 14 high severity vulnerabilities

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor xlsx vulnerability:** Keep watching for updates to the `xlsx` package that address the remaining vulnerabilities
2. **Consider alternative Excel libraries:** Evaluate `exceljs` or `node-xlsx` as potential replacements for `xlsx`
3. **Regular security audits:** Run `npm audit` regularly to catch new vulnerabilities
4. **Automated dependency updates:** Consider using tools like Dependabot or Renovate for automated security updates

## Verification

To verify the current security status, run:
```bash
npm audit
```

Expected output should show only 1 high severity vulnerability in the `xlsx` package.
