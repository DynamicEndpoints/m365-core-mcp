npx -y @smithery/cli install @DynamicEndpoints/m365-core-mcp --client claude
```

### Installing Manually
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

   # Optional Configuration
   # LOG_LEVEL=info    # debug, info, warn, error
   # PORT=3000         # Port for HTTP server if needed
   # USE_HTTP=true     # Set to 'true' to use HTTP transport instead of stdio
   # STATELESS=false   # Set to 'true' to use stateless HTTP mode (no session management)
   ```

     - User.ReadWrite.All
     - Mail.ReadWrite
     - MailboxSettings.ReadWrite
     - Organization.ReadWrite.All

     - Intune Administrator (for device management)
     - Reports Reader (for audit and reporting functions)

5. Build the server:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Transport Options

The server supports multiple transport options for MCP communication:

### stdio Transport

By default, the server uses stdio transport, which is ideal for:
- Command-line tools and direct integrations
- Local development and testing
- Integration with Smithery and other MCP clients that support stdio

### HTTP Transport

The server also supports HTTP transport with two modes:

#### Stateful Mode (With Session Management)

This is the default HTTP mode when `USE_HTTP=true` and `STATELESS=false`:
- Maintains session state between requests
- Supports server-to-client notifications via GET requests
- Handles session termination via DELETE requests
- Ideal for long-running sessions and interactive applications
- Provides better performance for multiple requests in the same session

#### Stateless Mode

Enable this mode by setting `USE_HTTP=true` and `STATELESS=true`:
- Creates a new server instance for each request
- No session state is maintained between requests
- Only supports POST requests (GET and DELETE are not supported)
- Ideal for RESTful scenarios where each request is independent
- Better for horizontally scaled deployments without shared session state
- Simpler API wrappers where session management isn't needed

To configure the transport options, set the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file:
```
USE_HTTP=true     # Use HTTP transport instead of stdio
STATELESS=false   # Use stateful mode with session management (default)
PORT=3000         # Port for the HTTP server
```
