# M365 Core MCP Server - Tool Descriptions & Intune Policy Enhancement ‚úÖ

## Overview
I've successfully addressed your Intune policy creation issues and enhanced all tool descriptions across the M365 Core MCP Server. Here's what was completed:

## üõ†Ô∏è New Intune Policy Creation Tool

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: `dynamicendpoints` tool was creating incomplete/incorrect Intune policies
- **Solution**: New dedicated `create_intune_policy` tool with schema validation

### New Tool Details
**Tool Name**: `create_intune_policy`
**Description**: "Create accurate and complete Intune policies for Windows or macOS with validated settings and proper structure"

**Parameters**:
```typescript
{
  platform: "windows" | "macos",
  policyType: "Configuration" | "Compliance" | "Security" | "Update" | "AppProtection" | "EndpointSecurity",
  displayName: string,
  description?: string,
  settings?: any,
  assignments?: any[]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Schema-driven validation** ensures correct policy structure
- ‚úÖ **Platform-specific handling** (Windows vs macOS)
- ‚úÖ **Reuses existing handlers** from `intune-macos-handler.ts` and `intune-windows-handler.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Type-safe parameters** prevent common errors
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling** with meaningful messages

### Usage Example
```typescript
{
  "platform": "windows",
  "policyType": "Configuration", 
  "displayName": "Windows Security Policy",
  "description": "Enhanced security configuration for Windows devices",
  "settings": {
    "passwordRequired": true,
    "passwordMinimumLength": 8,
    "screenLockTimeout": 300
  },
  "assignments": [
    {"target": "allUsers"}
  ]
}
```
